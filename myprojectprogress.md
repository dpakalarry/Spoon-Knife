There are many projects out there, some of them would be very interesting to work on. One of the first projects I found was 
software that runs on pinball machines. As it is a fairly large project, a blessed repository would probably be the better 
option for organizing the repository. This allows many people to work on it while eliminating single points of failure for the 
codebase.
